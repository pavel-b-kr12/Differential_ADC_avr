# Differential_ADC_avr
differential analog read with gain (PGA) for arduino Mega2560, Leonardo

## hardware
tested on atmega2560 board pins A0-A1 

but have to work on

mega1280

atmega32u4 Leonardo, pro micro (if pins A4 A5 available)

## What is it for
probably it is good for fast reading bridge sensors: weight strain gauge / load cell , current, analog hall, custom Wheatstone Bridges, ...

## TODO
make it as Arduino library

## main code from
<https://www.davidpilling.com/wiki/index.php/DiffADC>
there avail some explanation
